# Legal Review: QTech Study Apps Terms of Service & Privacy Policy
## Massachusetts Technology/App Business Perspective

**Reviewer Role:** Acting as Massachusetts attorney specializing in technology and mobile app businesses  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Client:** QTech Study Apps (Sole Proprietorship, Massachusetts)  
**Documents Reviewed:** Terms of Service & Privacy Policy for iOS educational apps

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Assessment:** ⚠️ **SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS REQUIRED**

While these documents provide a reasonable foundation, they contain several **critical gaps and vulnerabilities** specific to Massachusetts law and the sole proprietorship structure. The documents need significant modifications before publication.

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Estimated Revision Time:** 8-12 hours of legal work  
**Recommended Action:** Do not publish without attorney review and modification

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. MASSACHUSETTS CHAPTER 93A COMPLIANCE ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Issue:** Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A (Consumer Protection Act) is one of the strongest consumer protection statutes in the U.S. Your current terms may violate it.

**Problems Identified:**
- **Section 16.4 - Class Action Waiver:** Potentially UNENFORCEABLE in Massachusetts. Chapter 93A explicitly allows class actions and prohibits waiver of certain consumer rights.
- **Section 11.1 - "AS IS" Provisions:** Overly broad disclaimers may be invalid under Chapter 93A for consumer transactions.
- **Section 12 - Limitation of Liability:** Some limitations may be unenforceable for "unfair or deceptive" practices under Chapter 93A.

**Required Changes:**
```
ADD NEW SECTION - "Massachusetts Consumer Rights"

"Massachusetts Residents: Under Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A, 
you have certain rights that cannot be waived by this agreement, including:
- The right to sue for unfair or deceptive business practices
- The right to recover double or treble damages for willful violations
- The right to participate in class action lawsuits
- Protections against unconscionable contract terms

Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to waive your statutory rights 
under Chapter 93A. To the extent any provision conflicts with Chapter 93A, 
Chapter 93A shall control."
```

**Legal Basis:** M.G.L. c. 93A, §§ 2, 9, 11; *Heller v. Silverbranch Constr. Corp.*, 376 Mass. 621 (1978)

---

### 2. SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP LIABILITY EXPOSURE ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Issue:** As a sole proprietor, YOU ARE PERSONALLY LIABLE for all business debts, lawsuits, and obligations. The current documents don't adequately protect you.

**Personal Liability Risks:**
1. **Educational Content Claims:** If someone fails an exam and claims your content was inaccurate, they can sue YOU personally and go after your personal assets (house, car, savings, etc.)
2. **Data Breach:** If user data is compromised, YOU are personally liable under Massachusetts data breach laws (201 CMR 17.00)
3. **AI Misinformation:** If AI provides harmful advice (especially for medical apps like Phlebotomy), YOU are personally liable
4. **Consumer Protection Violations:** Chapter 93A allows for double/treble damages against YOU personally

**Severity:** Your current limitation of liability clauses provide MINIMAL protection because:
- They may be unenforceable under Chapter 93A
- They don't protect against intentional misconduct or gross negligence
- They don't shield personal assets in a sole proprietorship

**Recommended Immediate Actions:**
1. **FORM AN LLC IMMEDIATELY** - Massachusetts LLC formation costs ~$500 and provides liability protection
2. **Obtain Business Insurance:**
   - General Liability Insurance ($1M minimum)
   - Professional Liability/E&O Insurance ($1M-$2M for educational content)
   - Cyber Liability Insurance (REQUIRED given data collection)
   - Product Liability Insurance (for apps)
3. **Until LLC formed:** Add prominent disclaimer in both documents:

```
"IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS: QTech Study Apps is 
operated as a sole proprietorship. This means the business owner is 
personally liable for claims arising from your use of the applications. 
Our liability insurance coverage information is available upon request."
```

**Why This Matters:** Educational malpractice claims, even if frivolous, can cost $50,000-$200,000 to defend. Without an LLC, your personal assets are at risk.

---

### 3. MASSACHUSETTS DATA SECURITY LAW (201 CMR 17.00) ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Issue:** Massachusetts has the STRICTEST data security regulation in the U.S. Your Privacy Policy is incomplete.

**Required Compliance:**
Massachusetts 201 CMR 17.00 requires businesses that collect Massachusetts residents' personal information to:

1. **Designate Security Coordinator** (You, as sole proprietor)
2. **Written Information Security Program (WISP)** - MANDATORY
3. **Specific Technical Controls:**
   - ✅ Encryption in transit (you have SSL)
   - ✅ Encryption at rest (you mention AES-256)
   - ⚠️ Secure authentication (you have it, but must document)
   - ⚠️ Access controls (must document who accesses user data)
   - ⚠️ Employee training (even if just you)
   - ⚠️ Vendor management (RevenueCat, Amplitude, OpenAI contracts)

**Missing from Privacy Policy:**
```
ADD NEW SECTION (after Section 8 - Data Security):

"8.4 Massachusetts Data Security Compliance (201 CMR 17.00)

For Massachusetts residents, we maintain a comprehensive Written Information 
Security Program (WISP) that includes:
- Designation of a security coordinator responsible for the program
- Risk assessments of reasonably foreseeable threats
- Security policies for employees and contractors
- Access controls limiting access to personal information
- Encryption of transmitted and stored personal information
- Reasonable monitoring of systems for security breaches
- Employee training on security procedures
- Vendor oversight to ensure third-party compliance

A summary of our WISP is available upon request by Massachusetts residents."
```

**Action Required:** You MUST create a Written Information Security Program (WISP) document. I can provide a template, but key elements:
- Document your security practices
- Conduct annual risk assessment
- Have data breach response plan
- Ensure vendor contracts (RevenueCat, Amplitude, OpenAI) include data security provisions

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:** Up to $5,000 per violation + attorney's fees

---

### 4. DOING BUSINESS AS (DBA) REQUIREMENT ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue:** You're operating under "QTech Study Apps" but as a sole proprietor, your legal name is Connor Quigley.

**Massachusetts Law:** M.G.L. c. 110, § 5 requires any person conducting business under a name other than their own legal name to file a "Certificate of Business Name" (DBA) with their city/town clerk.

**Problems:**
1. **Contracts may be voidable** if you haven't filed DBA
2. **You cannot sue in the business name** without DBA
3. **Potential fines** for operating without DBA
4. **Banking issues** - banks may refuse to open business accounts

**Required Actions:**
1. **File DBA Certificate** with your local Massachusetts city/town clerk ($50-65 fee)
2. **Update documents** once filed:

```
MODIFY Section 27 (Contact Information) in TOS:
"QTech Study Apps
Connor Quigley, Sole Proprietor d/b/a QTech Study Apps
[Your City], Massachusetts
Certificate of Business Name filed [Date] with [City/Town] Clerk"
```

**Timeline:** File within 30 days, definitely before publishing these terms

---

### 5. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT LIABILITY - INSUFFICIENT DISCLAIMERS ⚠️ HIGH

**Issue:** Section 5 disclaimers are good but insufficient given the nature of your apps (medical, aviation).

**Specific Concerns:**

**Phlebotomy App:**
- Medical field = higher duty of care
- Incorrect information could lead to patient harm
- Massachusetts medical malpractice standards apply
- Need explicit disclaimer: Not replacing clinical training

**Part 107 Drone App:**
- FAA-regulated industry
- Safety implications if content is wrong
- Potential liability if user violates FAA regulations based on your app
- Need explicit disclaimer: Not replacing FAA-authorized training

**Recommended Additions:**

```
ADD to Section 5.4 (Medical and Professional Advice Disclaimer):

"SPECIFIC DISCLAIMERS BY APPLICATION:

Healthcare Applications (including Phlebotomy Test Prep):
Our healthcare-related applications are NOT a substitute for formal 
clinical education, hands-on training, or supervision by licensed 
healthcare professionals. These applications:
- Do not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment
- Are not approved by any medical licensing board
- Should not be relied upon for clinical decision-making
- Do not replace required clinical training or continuing education
- May not reflect current best practices or regulatory updates

CAUTION: Improper phlebotomy technique can cause patient injury. Always 
follow your institution's protocols and seek guidance from licensed 
supervisors.

Aviation/Drone Applications (including Part 107 Trainer):
Our aviation-related applications are NOT a substitute for FAA-authorized 
training or official FAA publications. These applications:
- Are not FAA-approved or endorsed
- Do not replace required FAA training courses
- May not reflect the most current FAA regulations (14 CFR)
- Are not a substitute for official FAA testing materials
- Should be verified against official FAA Advisory Circulars and regulations

CAUTION: Improper drone operation can result in injury, property damage, 
criminal penalties, and civil fines up to $25,000. Always consult official 
FAA regulations and your local FSDO before operating unmanned aircraft."
```

**Why This Matters:** Educational malpractice and professional training liability are growing areas of litigation. Specific disclaimers demonstrate due diligence.

---

### 6. AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION RENEWALS - PARTIAL COMPLIANCE ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Issue:** Section 4.2 covers auto-renewal but missing Massachusetts-specific disclosure requirements.

**Massachusetts Auto-Renewal Law:** M.G.L. c. 93 requires:
1. **Clear and conspicuous disclosure** of auto-renewal terms BEFORE purchase
2. **Acknowledgment/consent** from consumer
3. **Easy cancellation** mechanism
4. **Reminder before renewal** (recommended)

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ You disclose auto-renewal in TOS
- ⚠️ Unclear if disclosure shown BEFORE purchase in app
- ⚠️ No mention of pre-renewal reminders
- ⚠️ Cancellation requires going through Apple (acceptable, but must be clear)

**Required Addition:**

```
ADD to Section 4.2 (Subscription Terms):

"Massachusetts Auto-Renewal Disclosure:
Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing 
period unless you cancel before the renewal date. By subscribing, you 
explicitly authorize these recurring charges to your Apple ID account.

You may cancel auto-renewal at any time by:
1. Opening Settings on your iOS device
2. Tapping your name → Subscriptions
3. Selecting [App Name] subscription
4. Tapping 'Cancel Subscription'

Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You 
will retain access to premium features until that date.

We recommend setting a reminder before your renewal date if you wish to 
cancel."
```

---

### 7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY - COPPA COMPLIANCE GAPS ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Issue:** Section 2.1 (TOS) and Section 7 (Privacy) address children but have gaps.

**Problems:**
1. **Age Gate:** Do your apps verify age at signup? If not, you may unknowingly collect data from under-13 users
2. **Parental Consent Mechanism:** You mention requiring parental consent for under-18, but no mechanism described
3. **Massachusetts-Specific:** Massachusetts recognizes additional privacy protections for minors

**Required Changes:**

```
MODIFY Section 2.1 (Age Requirements) in TOS:

"2.1 Age Requirements
Our applications are intended for users aged 13 and older. 

Users Under 13: We do not knowingly collect personal information from 
children under 13 without verified parental consent as required by COPPA 
(Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). If you are under 13, do not 
use our applications or provide any information without verified parental 
consent.

Users 13-17: If you are between 13 and 17 years old, you represent that:
(a) You have obtained permission from a parent or legal guardian to use 
    these applications
(b) Your parent/guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms and our 
    Privacy Policy
(c) Your parent/guardian understands that we collect study progress, 
    performance data, and usage analytics

Parents/Guardians: If you believe your child under 13 has used our 
application without consent, or if you are a parent/guardian of a 
13-17 year old user and wish to review or delete their data, contact 
us immediately at qtechdev1@gmail.com with 'Minor Privacy Request' in 
the subject line."
```

**Recommended Technical Implementation:**
- Add age verification at first launch
- Require parental email for users 13-17
- Send parental consent notification email

---

### 8. AI/OPENAI INTEGRATION - INSUFFICIENT DISCLOSURE ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Issue:** Section 6 (AI Features) and Privacy Policy mention OpenAI but lack important disclosures about AI limitations and third-party processing.

**Massachusetts Consumer Protection Context:**
- AI-generated misinformation could be considered "unfair or deceptive" under Chapter 93A
- Inadequate disclosure of AI limitations = potential liability
- Third-party AI processing = additional privacy concerns

**Required Enhancements:**

```
ADD to Section 6.2 (AI Content Limitations) in TOS:

"6.2 AI Content Limitations and Risks

IMPORTANT: Our AI tutor uses OpenAI's language models (ChatGPT/GPT-4). 
These are general-purpose AI systems NOT specifically trained on exam 
content or certified by licensing authorities.

AI-generated content may:
- Contain factual errors or outdated information
- Provide plausible-sounding but incorrect explanations
- Generate content that contradicts official regulations or guidelines
- Reflect biases present in training data
- Produce inconsistent answers to the same question
- "Hallucinate" (generate false but confident-sounding information)

You should ALWAYS:
✓ Verify AI explanations against official sources
✓ Cross-reference with authoritative publications
✓ Consult licensed professionals for professional guidance
✓ Use AI responses as supplementary learning only

NEVER rely solely on AI-generated content for:
✗ Professional certification exam answers
✗ Clinical or patient care decisions
✗ Aviation safety or regulatory compliance
✗ Legal or regulatory interpretations

Limitation of Liability: We are not liable for any consequences arising 
from reliance on AI-generated content, including but not limited to exam 
failures, professional errors, or regulatory violations."
```

**Privacy Policy Addition:**

```
ADD to Section 11.1 (AI Tutor Processing):

"Data Sharing with OpenAI:
When you use our AI tutor features, your messages are transmitted to 
OpenAI's servers for processing. OpenAI processes this data according to 
their terms:
- OpenAI API Terms: https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use
- OpenAI Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
- OpenAI Data Usage Policy: https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies

As of our last review, OpenAI states they do not use API data to train 
their models, but their policies may change. We implement technical 
safeguards including:
- Anonymized identifiers (no names sent)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure SSL/TLS encryption in transit
- Session-based conversation storage

You can review OpenAI's current data practices at the links above."
```

---

### 9. REVENUE CAT & AMPLITUDE DATA SHARING - INCOMPLETE DISCLOSURES ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Issue:** Privacy Policy mentions these services but lacks required details under Massachusetts law and privacy best practices.

**Problem:** Massachusetts consumers have right to know:
- Exactly what data is shared
- Whether data is sold or just processed
- How to opt out of third-party sharing
- Data retention by third parties

**Required Enhancement:**

```
ADD NEW TABLE to Section 4.3 (Third-Party Services) in Privacy Policy:

"Detailed Third-Party Data Sharing:

| Service | Data Shared | Purpose | Opt-Out Available | Data Sale? |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| RevenueCat | Apple ID, Device ID, Purchase History, Subscription Status | Subscription management, revenue tracking | No (required for service) | NO |
| Amplitude | Device ID, Session Data, Feature Usage, Quiz Performance, Screen Views, Time Spent | Analytics, product improvement | Yes (iOS Settings → Privacy → Tracking) | NO |
| OpenAI | Chat Messages, Anonymized User ID, Conversation Context | AI-powered responses | Yes (don't use AI tutor) | NO (per OpenAI policy) |
| Apple (iCloud) | Study Progress, Quiz History, Preferences, Settings | Data sync across devices | Yes (iOS Settings → [Apple ID] → iCloud) | NO |

We do NOT sell your personal information to any third party for monetary 
or other valuable consideration. All data sharing serves operational 
purposes only."
```

---

### 10. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION - INSUFFICIENT DETAIL ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Issue:** Section 8.3 (Privacy Policy) mentions breach notification but doesn't comply with Massachusetts specifics.

**Massachusetts Data Breach Law (M.G.L. c. 93H):**
- Notification required "as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay"
- Must notify Attorney General if affecting >1,000 Massachusetts residents
- Must notify consumer reporting agencies if affecting >1,000 Massachusetts residents
- Must provide specific information in notification

**Required Enhancement:**

```
REPLACE Section 8.3 (Data Breach Notification) with:

"8.3 Data Breach Notification

In the event of a data breach affecting your personal information, we will 
comply with Massachusetts data breach notification law (M.G.L. c. 93H).

Timeline and Process:
- Notification within 72 hours of discovery (or sooner if required)
- Notification to Massachusetts Attorney General (if 1,000+ MA residents affected)
- Notification to consumer reporting agencies (if 1,000+ MA residents affected)

Your notification will include:
1. Description of the breach and compromised information
2. Steps we are taking to address the breach
3. Contact information for questions
4. Recommended actions you should take (e.g., credit monitoring)
5. Your rights under Massachusetts law

Methods of notification:
- Email (if we have your email address)
- In-app notification
- Website posting (if contact information unavailable)
- Written notice by first-class mail (for Massachusetts residents)

Massachusetts residents may contact the Attorney General's Office with 
concerns about data breaches:
Office of the Attorney General
Consumer Advocacy and Response Division
One Ashburton Place
Boston, MA 02108
Phone: (617) 727-8400"
```

## MODERATE PRIORITY ISSUES

### 11. ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE (ADA/Section 508)

**Issue:** No mention of accessibility commitments or accommodations.

**Risk:** Potential ADA violations if apps are not accessible to users with disabilities.

**Recommendation:** Add accessibility statement:

```
ADD NEW SECTION 28 in TOS:

"28. Accessibility Commitment

We strive to make our applications accessible to users with disabilities. 
Our apps are designed with:
- VoiceOver compatibility for visually impaired users
- Dynamic Type support for text size adjustment
- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard navigation where applicable

If you encounter accessibility barriers, please contact us at 
qtechdev1@gmail.com with 'Accessibility Issue' in the subject line. We 
will work to address accessibility concerns in a timely manner.

Massachusetts residents: You have the right to request reasonable 
accommodations under state and federal disability laws."
```

---

### 12. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - INCOMPLETE

**Issue:** Section 8.1 claims IP ownership but doesn't address potential third-party IP in question banks.

**Questions:**
- Are your quiz questions original or sourced from public domain materials?
- Do any questions reference copyrighted images, diagrams, or charts?
- Could exam organizations claim IP in question formats?

**Recommendation:** Add to Section 8.1:

```
"Third-Party Content: Some content may incorporate information from 
publicly available sources, government publications, or materials used 
under fair use for educational purposes. We respect intellectual property 
rights and promptly respond to valid DMCA takedown notices.

If you believe content infringes your intellectual property rights, 
contact qtechdev1@gmail.com with 'IP Complaint' in the subject."
```

---

### 13. GDPR/INTERNATIONAL USERS - OVER-BROAD CLAIMS

**Issue:** Privacy Policy has extensive GDPR provisions but you operate solely in Massachusetts.

**Problem:** Claiming GDPR compliance creates legal obligations you may not be able to fulfill as a sole proprietor.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. **Option A (Recommended):** Limit service to U.S. users and remove GDPR sections
2. **Option B:** Geo-block EEA users
3. **Option C:** Consult GDPR attorney and ensure full compliance (expensive)

**Geographic Restriction Language:**

```
ADD to Section 18 (International Use) in TOS:

"18. Geographic Restrictions

Our applications are intended for users in the United States only. We do 
not target users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or 
other jurisdictions with complex data protection requirements.

If you access our applications from outside the United States, you do so 
at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws. We 
make no representations that our services comply with laws outside the 
United States.

We reserve the right to limit access from specific geographic regions."
```

---

## FORMATTING & TECHNICAL ISSUES

### 14. Effective Date Error

**Issue:** Both documents show "Last Updated: October 10, 2025" - this is in the FUTURE.

**Fix:** Change to actual date or "Effective as of [Date]"

### 15. Incomplete Placeholders

**Privacy Policy Section 18:** Still contains "[Your App Name]" placeholder

**Fix:** Either make dynamic or create app-specific versions

---

## RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL SECTIONS

### 16. TAX & SALES TAX DISCLOSURE

As a Massachusetts sole proprietor collecting payments:

```
ADD to Section 4 (Subscription Services):

"4.6 Taxes

Subscription prices do not include applicable sales, use, or other taxes. 
You are responsible for paying all taxes associated with your purchase.

Massachusetts residents: Sales tax may apply to your subscription pursuant 
to M.G.L. c. 64H. Tax amounts are calculated and collected by Apple as part 
of your App Store purchase."
```

### 17. GOVERNING LAW CLARIFICATION

Section 16.1 correctly specifies Massachusetts law, but should clarify federal law application:

```
MODIFY Section 16.1:

"These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Certain aspects 
of our services (such as intellectual property, export controls, and electronic 
transactions) may also be governed by applicable federal law."
```

---

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: DO NOT PUBLISH CURRENT DOCUMENTS

The documents as written create significant legal exposure, particularly around:
- Massachusetts Chapter 93A violations (class action waiver, unfair disclaimers)
- Sole proprietorship personal liability
- Data security law compliance gaps
- AI liability exposure

### Priority 2: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)

1. **File DBA Certificate** - Required to legally operate as "QTech Study Apps"
2. **Create WISP Document** - Required by Massachusetts 201 CMR 17.00
3. **Get Cyber Insurance Quote** - Shop 3-5 carriers
4. **Revise Documents** - Implement critical changes outlined above

### Priority 3: LONGER-TERM BUSINESS STRUCTURE

**Strongly Recommend Forming an LLC:**
- Filing fee: $500
- Annual report: $500/year
- Protection: Shields personal assets from business liability
- Credibility: Preferred by insurance companies and business partners
- Tax flexibility: Can elect S-Corp status if profitable

**LLC Benefits for Your Business:**
- Limits personal liability for data breaches
- Protects personal assets from educational content claims
- Allows better insurance coverage
- Provides more professional image
- Easier to sell business in future

### Priority 4: Professional Engagement

**Recommend hiring:**
1. **Massachusetts business attorney** - One-time review and LLC formation ($2,500-3,500)
2. **Insurance broker** - Shop cyber/E&O policies (no cost to you)
3. **Accountant** - Tax implications of LLC vs. sole proprietor ($300-500)

## DISCLAIMER

**IMPORTANT:** This review is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice or create an attorney-client relationship. The reviewer is acting in a hypothetical capacity as requested. 

**For actual legal advice**, you must:
1. Retain a licensed Massachusetts attorney
2. Provide complete facts about your business operations
3. Obtain formal legal opinion in writing

**This review is based on:**
- Massachusetts law as of October 2025
- Limited information about actual business operations
- Assumptions about app functionality and data practices
- General legal principles, not case-specific advice

**Real attorney consultation is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED before:**
- Publishing these terms and privacy policy
- Launching new apps
- Making significant business decisions
- Responding to any legal claims or regulatory inquiries

---

## CONCLUSION

Your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy demonstrate good faith effort and cover many important issues. However, they contain critical gaps that create significant liability exposure, particularly given:

1. **Massachusetts' strict consumer protection laws** (Chapter 93A)
2. **Sole proprietorship structure** (unlimited personal liability)
3. **Data security requirements** (201 CMR 17.00)
4. **Nature of your apps** (medical and aviation content)
5. **AI integration risks** (OpenAI third-party processing)

**Bottom Line:** Budget $6,000-10,000 for first-year legal compliance. This is an investment that protects your personal assets and business viability.

**The good news:** You've identified these issues BEFORE launch, which is the right time to address them. Many app developers don't think about legal compliance until after they're sued.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this analysis carefully
2. Prioritize critical issues (Chapter 93A, WISP, DBA)
3. Get quotes for business insurance
4. Consult with local Massachusetts attorney for formal review
5. Consider LLC formation
6. Implement recommended changes to documents

**Questions or clarification needed on any issues? Happy to discuss further.**
