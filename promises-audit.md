# Privacy Policy & Terms of Service - Promises Audit

## PRIVACY POLICY PROMISES

### ‚úÖ LEGITIMATE PROMISES (Keep as-is)
These are standard legal language or things you can actually do:

1. **Section 4.2** - "We will notify you of any such change" (business transfer) - Standard legal language
2. **Section 5** - Data retention claims - Already vague enough ("as long as necessary")
3. **Section 6.1** - "Contact us at qtechdev1@gmail.com with your request" - You can do this
4. **Section 6.3** - "Uninstalling the app will delete this local data" - True statement
5. **Section 6.4** - Notification preferences through iOS settings - True, iOS native feature
6. **Section 13** - Policy updates posted on website - You can do this

### ‚ö†Ô∏è QUESTIONABLE PROMISES (Need Review)

1. **Section 7.2 - Children's Privacy**
   - ‚ùå "We will delete the information within 30 days"
   - ‚ùå "We will cease collecting information from that child"
   - **ISSUE:** Can you actually track and delete a specific child's data within 30 days? Do you have systems to identify and isolate child data?

2. **Section 8.3 - Data Breach Notification**
   - ‚ùå "Notify you within 72 hours of discovery"
   - **ISSUE:** This is VERY specific and legally binding. Can you guarantee 72 hours?
   - **ISSUE:** How will you notify users with no email/account system? Device-based apps can't push notifications to specific users easily.
   - ‚ùå Lists specific steps (describe breach, explain steps, recommend actions)
   - **ISSUE:** Can you actually do all this within 72 hours?

3. **Section 9.3 - GDPR Transfer Safeguards**
   - ‚ùå "We rely on Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission"
   - **ISSUE:** Do you actually have SCCs in place with RevenueCat, Amplitude, OpenAI?
   - **ISSUE:** This requires actual legal contracts and compliance procedures

4. **Section 15 - GDPR Legal Basis**
   - ‚ùå Claims about "Contractual Necessity," "Legitimate Interests," "Consent"
   - **ISSUE:** Do you operate in the EEA? Do you need GDPR compliance at all?

5. **Section 16 - Do Not Track**
   - ‚ùå "You can control tracking through iOS privacy settings and in-app privacy controls"
   - **ISSUE:** What "in-app privacy controls"? You don't have analytics opt-out in the app

6. **Section 18 - Contact Response Time**
   - ‚ùå "We strive to respond to privacy inquiries within 30 days"
   - **ISSUE:** This sets an expectation. Can you meet it consistently as a solo dev?
   - ‚ùå "Data Protection Officer (GDPR)"
   - **ISSUE:** You're not a DPO. This is misleading. Only large companies need DPOs.

## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ACTION

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Remove or Fix

#### 1. Data Breach Notification (Privacy Policy Section 8.3)
**Current Promise:** "Notify you within 72 hours"

**Problem:** 
- You have no email list or push notification system for individual users
- Device-based apps can't notify specific users of breaches
- 72 hours is extremely aggressive even for large companies

**Recommendation:**
```
Replace with:
"In the event of a data breach affecting your personal information, we will 
comply with applicable data breach notification laws and take appropriate 
steps to notify affected users through available channels."
```

#### 2. GDPR Sections (Privacy Policy Sections 9.3, 15, 18)
**Current Promise:** Standard Contractual Clauses, DPO, full GDPR compliance

**Problem:**
- You're a Massachusetts sole proprietor, not operating in EEA
- You don't have SCCs with vendors
- You're not a Data Protection Officer
- This creates massive legal liability you can't meet

**Recommendation:**
- Remove Section 9.3 entirely (Transfer Safeguards)
- Remove Section 15 entirely (GDPR Legal Basis)
- Remove "Data Protection Officer" from Section 18
- Simplify Section 6.6 (European Privacy Rights) or remove it

#### 3. Children's Privacy 30-Day Deletion (Privacy Policy Section 7.2)
**Current Promise:** "We will delete the information within 30 days"

**Problem:**
- With device-based apps and no accounts, how do you identify a specific child's data?
- Server-side data (analytics, AI logs) is not tied to identifiable children
- You can't delete data you can't identify

**Recommendation:**
```
Replace with:
"If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has used 
our application, contact us at qtechdev1@gmail.com. We will take appropriate 
steps to address the situation in compliance with COPPA requirements."
```

#### 4. In-App Privacy Controls (Privacy Policy Section 16)
**Current Promise:** "control tracking through in-app privacy controls"

**Problem:** You don't have in-app analytics opt-out

**Recommendation:**
```
Replace with:
"Our applications do not currently respond to 'Do Not Track' browser signals. 
You can control some tracking through iOS Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Tracking."
```

#### 5. Response Time Promise (Privacy Policy Section 18)
**Current Promise:** "We strive to respond within 30 days"

**Problem:** Sets expectations you might not meet as solo dev

**Recommendation:**
```
Replace with:
"We will respond to privacy inquiries as promptly as possible."
```

#### 6. In-App Support Feature (TOS Section 27)
**Current Promise:** "Support: Available through in-app support feature"

**Problem:** You likely just have a mailto: link, not a "feature"

**Recommendation:**
```
Replace with:
"Email: qtechdev1@gmail.com"
(Remove the "Support: Available through in-app support feature" line)
```
